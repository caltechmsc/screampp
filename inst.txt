preferred using distutils:

cd scream

python setup.py build

this also runs swig which creates py_scream_ee.py and py_scream_ee_wrap.cpp in the swig directory

if one wants to copy the python file to the build directory, run again

python setup.py build

now also the py_scream_ee.py is copied because it already exists

-----------


in any case one should have these files:

py_scream_ee.py
SCREAM.py
SCREAM_BindingSite.py
SCREAM_wrap.py
_py_scream_ee.so
timing.py
