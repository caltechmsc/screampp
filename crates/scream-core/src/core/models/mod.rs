//! Core data models for molecular structures.
//!
//! This module contains the fundamental data structures used to represent
//! molecular systems in SCREAM++, including atoms, residues, chains, and
//! their topological relationships. These models provide the foundation
//! for molecular modeling and simulation algorithms.
